# Multitype Reflection Usage in Go

An example of the reflection library in Go. Two important examples are shown:

1. How to read a value and return it from a function that accepts two structs of different type
2. How to set a value to a struct field from a function that accepts two structs of different type

Both functions mentioned above are exported from the `common` package.

Refer to `main.go` for the usage.
